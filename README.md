# piano-player

You can find the code on develop branch. I am currently creating an API of music chords and my aim is to connect it with this piano on a further step. For more info check out my music-chords-api repository.

This piano player was created with pure javascript, html and css. It can be played with computer keyboards, have fun trying! Feedbacks are welcome.
